This is a temporary place for me to host some rubbish
(this may be more than temporary)

## I've made (making) this a single page application!
I've used some code from [here](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages), but I haven't copied any!! I've read it through and tried to understand it without directly plagiarising anything. Please send me a message if you (yes, you! the random person reading this, quickly leaving after, and getting back to whatever you were trying to do before you stopped for a break. A break, it's always a break. You sit there and try, just **try** to be productive only to get sidetracked on some stupid little thing, it always happens. I dont want this, I don't need this! I just want to be fulfilled, I just need a meaning... I can't take it anymore!! ) find any bugs!

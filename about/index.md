# About This website
## Thanks for checking out my website!
I plan to use this website to host projects and games I've made, as well as other random stuff.
It's built with GitHub pages, however it uses some custom scripts to dynamically load markdown files for each page<sup><r>*</r></sup> - this makes it really easy to develop! It's also what's called a <r>Single Page Application</r>, which means whenever you navigate across the site, it doesn't refresh the page, and instead changes the HTML dynamically!

<sup><r>*add '/index.md' on the end of any url on this website!</r></sup>

This website also uses [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) to make emojis look better and consistent. âœ¨

# About Me ![](/images/transparent.png)
My name is <r>jumbledFox</r>, and I'm a 16 year old programmer from the UK.

When I'm not programming (procrastinating) I like to play games like <r>Half-Life</r>, <r>CS:GO</r>, and <r>Portal</r> - I love Valve games!

I also like to collect vinyl records, it's not like they're durable, quick to use, or easy to store, I just like having __proper__ physical media, no matter _how_ obsolete!

Speaking of music, I really like <r>Genesis</r>, <r>Supertramp</r>, and <r>Oingo Boingo</r>! I also like a lot of other groups, such as Pink Floyd, Steventhedreamer, Thomas Dolby, Men Without Hats, ELO, The Police, Radiohead, Kraftwerk, and The Beatles. Very cliche, I know.

I love to go on long bike rides whilst listening to albums I like (Safely of course!!! Only having one earphone in!!!), I especially love to listen to <r>Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of War of The Worlds</r>.

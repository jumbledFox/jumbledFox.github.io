## Why
While downloading a color palette from [Lospec](https://lospec.com/) is quick and easy, they're laid out rather inefficiently, like this:

![Example of bad layout](example-sulu-bad.png "Example of bad layout")

Now, what I like to do is make custom layouts of the palettes we know and love, they make selecting colors alot quicker, and they're nicer on the eyes.

![Example of good layout](example-sulu-good.png "Example of good layout")

The problem with these is that they require color picker to be in 'big mode', I always have it like this so its no problem for me, but also you dont really need advanced color picking / manipulating options when you're using a palette... Oh well! It's part of my workflow, hopefully this page will help _someone_...

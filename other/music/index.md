# Music
I've been making little songs in FL Studio for a little while now, they're not the best, but I love 'em!

Just a warning: The names are very _iffy_, whenever I save a song I put the name as whatever's in my mind.

<r>_Please don't steal these, I beg of you!! (or.. if you do, then at least credit me and tell me about it!, not that anyone's gonna steal these... maybe I'm being too optimistic)_ </r>

I made these using lots of different (and probably quite goofy) methods. I use a plugin called <r>Prophanity</r>, as well as the Earthbound soundfont, and others!!

# Tracker stuff

Recently I've been using music tracker software instead of FL Studio, and I'm loving it! I use Schism Tracker.

This is my first track, made in a few hours over a few days. (The video compressed to 4mb, making it even more authentic to the era!)

Why doesn't your browser support the little audio player thing?

This is a little chiptune song I made quite some time ago, I used <r>Neochip</r> for the lovely sound.

## Map.mp3

Come on.. what are you using that doesn't support an audio player? Netscape Navigator??
</audio> 

This is a song I created for a Minecraft map younger me wanted to make but never finished, this was absolutely ages ago as well. The instruments are the Minecraft noteblock sounds.

I made this one during the Polymars SEAJAM for my submission: [Trash and Lasers](/games/trash-and-lasers)! It never got used, however I quite like this one and would like to one day develop it further.

<hr>

## Odd.mp4?? mp4?
Yes, it's an mp4 file! A recording of FL Studio playing the track..

I did it this way because I wanted you to see the layers that make up something like this, and not because <r>Neochip</r> was playing up and not exporting properly..

# _THE LATER YEARS_
## This stuff is more recent!
Around this time I stopped using <r>Neochip</r> due to it always crashing!!! I switched over to a lovely synthesiser called <r>Prophanity</r>.

Inspired by popular youtuber <r>Kliksphilip</r> and his father's music, I made this little track. I quite enjoy its repetitive melody, one that was achieved by randomly clicking around on the piano roll.

This was just me goofily messing around, but I like it enough to put it here.

A nice little melody I made, again, all of these need to be seriously developed before they turn into anything more than a concept. Don't ask for the version with vocals, I wish to forget ever trying to sing...

I made this one for a [Swag Weasels](/games/swag-weaselz) sequel, its currently in mid-development hell...

Another one inspired by the style of <r>Kliksphilip</r>'s father, <r>Steventhedreamer</r>. I took inspiration from his song [Electronic Voluntary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktUd6imka5Y), although I could never compete with perfection.

## Fox.mp3

Wowzers, another one inspired by them.. it's almost like the songs I listen to all of the time have an impact on me! <r>Steventhedreamer</r>'s album [Synchobonk Collection](https://open.spotify.com/album/3BtmhsxvxavvkC2naRdXin?si=-yot_5s-T5uofAWBSUxJow) is a brilliant listen, by the way.

This one I just love, the ascending notes and crispy warm square waves create a lovely sense of nostalgia, I was inspired to make this when I listened to some of the Undertale soundtrack (Most notably [Fallen Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B69GfSqEZEs)) and felt reminiscent of the past.
And before you ask, I KNOW THAT I SPELT IT WRONG!!!

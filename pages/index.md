# Under Construction
## Forever

Sorry, but this is driving me insane, I think I might remake it completely, I'm also thinking of learning Rust and making something cool, I might as well just move to the countryside and live out the rest of my days an Amish farmer.

One day I'll get this done, it's not too hard, it's just that I've spent all weekend doing it and I need a break - I'll probably get this up and running in the holidays or something.

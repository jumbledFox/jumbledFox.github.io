# jumbledFox's website
## Welcome to my website!
Hello, I'm jumbledFox! I'm a 15 year old programmer from the UK.

This is the janky website I made to show people my projects - I hope you like it!

Here are some things I've made...

---

[Favibird](/favibird) - A flappy bird game played in the favicon

[Trash and Lasers](/trash-and-lasers) - A game about destroying trash in the ocean with lasers! Made for the Polymars [SEAJAM](https://itch.io/jam/seajam) (This doesnt work yet!!! I'll fix it soon, but for now it works [here](/pages/trash-and-lasers))

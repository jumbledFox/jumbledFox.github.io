# About This website
## Thanks for checking out my website!
I plan to use this website to host projects and games I've made, as well as other random stuff.
It's built with GitHub pages, however it uses some custom scripts to dynamically load markdown files for each page - this makes it really easy to develop! It's also what's called a <r>Single Page Application</r>, which means whenever you navigate across the site, it doesn't refresh the page, and instead changes the HTML dynamically!

<r>-- More info about me coming soon --</r>

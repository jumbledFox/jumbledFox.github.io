Move your mouse to aim, click to shoot

Pause the game by pressing the big blue pause button on the top

Pressing the green buttons switches guns, however using the numbers on your keyboard feels a lot cooler

CRED is your street cred, how many people you've killed - you start unlocking 'drip' at high enough amounts!

SWAG is your health - you gain some every now and then

Powerups spawn every minute or so - One of them makes bullets bouncy, and the other makes bullets more penetrative!

This was a lot of fun to make, I really like the art and sounds (all made by me) and hope to one day make it properly.. Maybe in C++? ðŸ¤”

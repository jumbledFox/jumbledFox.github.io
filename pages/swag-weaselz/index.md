## The description on scratch
"Move your mouse to aim, click to shoot
Pressing numbers switches guns, 1 is a pistol, 2 is some kind of SMG, and 3 is a shotgun

CRED is your street cred, how many people you've killed - you start unlocking 'drip' at high enough amounts!

SWAG is your health - you gain some every now and then

Powerups spawn every minute or so - One of them makes bullets bouncy, and the other makes bullets more penetrative!"


This was a lot of fun to make, I really like the art and sounds (all made by me) and hope to one day make it properly.. Maybe in C++? ðŸ¤”

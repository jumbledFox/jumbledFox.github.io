<p>Swag Weasels is a quick little shoot-em-up I made in around a day for a friend of mine's birthday.</p>
<p>You play as a hip and trendy weasel being barraged by an onslaught of cubic killers, but worry not, for you have three tough and trusty firearms at your disposal!</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's some epic box art I made
<img src="swagdoom.png" style="width: auto; image-rendering: crisp-edges;"></p>
<hr />
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>Move the mouse to aim, and click or tap to shoot!</p>
<p>Switch weapons using the buttons at the top, or (for the speedier players out there), with the number keys on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Your 'Cred' (street cred) is how many kills you've got. At high enough amounts you start unlocking some pretty sweet articles of clothing!</p>
<p>Your 'Swag' is your health! It increases periodically, but those pesky enemies will do their best to bring it down.</p>
<p>Powerups spawn every now and then, too! One of them makes bullets bouncy, and the other makes bullets more penetrative.</p>
<hr />
<h2>I hope you enjoy it!</h2>
<p>This was a lot of fun to make, one day I hope to make a sequal, maybe in Rust with Macroquad!</p>
<p>This used to be hosted on Scratch, but I decided to keep it private and host it here instead, as blood and guns (although cartoony) might be a bit too gory for the Scratch community guidelines.</p>

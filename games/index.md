Here are some of the games I've made, not to be played during school hours!!!

[Favibird](/games/favibird) - A flappy bird game played in the favicon.

[Trash and Lasers](/games/trash-and-lasers) - A game about destroying trash in the ocean with lasers! Made for the Polymars [SEAJAM](https://itch.io/jam/seajam).

[Swag Weaselz](/games/swag-weaselz) - Made in around a day, this simple scratch game about shooting blocky green enemies is weasel-tastic.

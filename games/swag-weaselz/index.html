<p>Swag Weasels is a quick little shoot-em-up I made in around a day for a friend of mine's birthday.</p>
<p>You play as a hip and trendy weasel being barraged by an onslaught of cubic killers, but worry not, for you have three tough and trusty firearms at your disposal!</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's the epic box art I made!!!</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>Your first weapon of choice is a pistol, Moderately strong and quick to fire, however not to be outdone, your seconds weapon, an SMG, fires in infinite burts of accelerated auricular glory; however it's not as damaging as the former. Your third firearm packs quite a penetrative punch, this hefty shotgun may take some time to reload but boy does it fire, six times to be exact!</p>
<p>Move your mouse around the screen to aim, and click (or tap) to shoot! You can switch guns by pressing the buttons at the top, or for the more speedy players out there, press the number keys on your keyboard. You can pause the game by the pressing the big blue pause button - click anywhere to resume.</p>
<p><r>CRED</r> is your street cred, how many people you've killed - you start unlocking some pretty sweet articles of clothing at high enough amounts! <r>SWAG</r> is your health - you gain some every now and then, but those pesky and pointy opponents will try their best to drain it!</p>
<p>Powerups spawn every now and then, too! One of them makes bullets bouncy, and the other makes bullets more penetrative.</p>

<h2>I hope you enjoy it!</h2>
<p>This was a lot of fun to make, I really like the art and sounds (all made by me) and hope to one day make it properly.. Maybe in <del>C++</del> Rust? ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>This used to be up on scratch but I decided to keep it private and host it here instead, as it might be too gory for the community guidelines.</p>
<p>Yes there are a few bugs, but - not to sound dispassionate - I don't really care.</p>

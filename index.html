<h1>THINGS I'VE DONE</h1>
<h2><em>GAMES</em></h2>
<p>I've made a few games in my time, some more than others.. Here they are in all their glory.</p>
<p><a href="/games/swag-weaselz">Swag Weaselz</a> - Made in around a day, this simple scratch game about shooting blocky green enemies is weasel-tastic. Now featuring some epic doom-style box art I drew!</p>
<p><a href="/games/trash-and-lasers">Trash and Lasers</a> -  A game about destroying trash in the ocean with lasers! Made for the Polymars <a href="https://itch.io/jam/seajam">SEAJAM</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/games/favibird">Favibird</a> - A flappy bird game played in the favicon.</p>
</div><div class="body">
<h2><em>Electronics</em></h2>
<p>From gizmos to gadgets, I like to tinker. Here are some physical things I've made, more to come in the future.</p>
<p><a href="/projects/the-internet">The Internet</a> - My homemade prop of The Internet from The IT Crowd.</p>
<p><a href="/projects/led-flashing-light-mask">LED Flashing Light Mask</a> - An eye mask that flashes red light at a user-defined speed and brightness. Made for my mum</p>
<h2><em>Other various projects</em></h2>

<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Hello!!! You can call me jumbledFox. I program in Rust, Python, and C++, as well as the occasional website overhaul.</p>
<p>I'm only recently learning Rust after a good few years of C++, getting used to it is going to take some time!</p>
<p>My favourite bands are probably The Police and Genesis currently, however recently I've been getting into artists like 100 gecs, and I really love them!!!!</p>
<p>I love Half-Life, CS:GO, and Portal, they're some of my favourite games and huge inspirations in my projects :3</p>
<p>I've been having cold showers for <span id="coldshowers">---</span> days now</p>
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    // Live cold shower update
    var date1 = new Date("10/22/2021");
    var date2 = new Date();

    var Difference_In_Time = date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();

    var Difference_In_Days = Difference_In_Time / (1000 * 3600 * 24);

    document.getElementById("coldshowers").innerHTML = Math.floor(Difference_In_Days) + " days";
});

<h1>ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
<p>This website was generated with my static website generator <a href="https://github.com/jumbledFox/Sting">Sting</a>, named after Sting of 'The Police' fame.</p>
<p>I designed it myself, it uses the css mix-blend-mode multiply to make anything the background image, which I think looks really nice!!</p>

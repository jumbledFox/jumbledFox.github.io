<p>I copied this from my old website - I still need to update it!!</p>

<h1>Music</h1>
<p>I've been making little songs in FL Studio for a little while now, they're not the best, but I love 'em!</p>
<p>Just a warning: The names are very <em>iffy</em>, whenever I save a song I put the name as whatever's in my mind.</p>
<p><r>_Please don't steal these, I beg of you!! (or.. if you do, then at least credit me and tell me about it!, not that anyone's gonna steal these... maybe I'm being too optimistic)_ </r></p>
<p>I made these using lots of different (and probably quite goofy) methods. I use a plugin called <r>Prophanity</r>, as well as the Earthbound soundfont, and others!!</p>
<foxhr>
<p><r>/* This part of the page is new and cool!! */</r></p>
<h1>Tracker stuff</h1>
<p>Recently I've been using music tracker software instead of FL Studio, and I'm loving it! I use Schism Tracker.</p>
<p>This is my first track, made in a few hours over a few days. (The video compressed to 4mb, making it even more authentic to the era!)</p>

Why doesn't your browser support the little audio player thing?

<p>This is a little chiptune song I made quite some time ago, I used <r>Neochip</r> for the lovely sound.</p>

<h2>Map.mp3</h2>
<audio controls>
  <source src="/map.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
Come on.. what are you using that doesn't support an audio player? Netscape Navigator??
</audio> 
<p>This is a song I created for a Minecraft map younger me wanted to make but never finished, this was absolutely ages ago as well. The instruments are the Minecraft noteblock sounds.</p>

<h2>Titlelaser.wav</h2>

<p>I made this one during the Polymars SEAJAM for my submission: <a href="/games/trash-and-lasers">Trash and Lasers</a>! It never got used, however I quite like this one and would like to one day develop it further.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Odd.mp4?? mp4?</h2>
<p>Yes, it's an mp4 file! A recording of FL Studio playing the track..</p>
<p>I did it this way because I wanted you to see the layers that make up something like this, and not because <r>Neochip</r> was playing up and not exporting properly..</p>

<h1><em>THE LATER YEARS</em></h1>
<h2>This stuff is more recent!</h2>
<p>Around this time I stopped using <r>Neochip</r> due to it always crashing!!! I switched over to a lovely synthesiser called <r>Prophanity</r>.</p>

<h2>Klik.wav</h2>

<p>Inspired by popular youtuber <r>Kliksphilip</r> and his father's music, I made this little track. I quite enjoy its repetitive melody, one that was achieved by randomly clicking around on the piano roll.</p>

<p>This was just me goofily messing around, but I like it enough to put it here.</p>

<p>A nice little melody I made, again, all of these need to be seriously developed before they turn into anything more than a concept. Don't ask for the version with vocals, I wish to forget ever trying to sing...</p>

<p>I made this one for a <a href="/games/swag-weaselz">Swag Weasels</a> sequel, its currently in mid-development hell...</p>

<p>Another one inspired by the style of <r>Kliksphilip</r>'s father, <r>Steventhedreamer</r>. I took inspiration from his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktUd6imka5Y">Electronic Voluntary</a>, although I could never compete with perfection.</p>

<h2>Fox.mp3</h2>

<p>Wowzers, another one inspired by them.. it's almost like the songs I listen to all of the time have an impact on me! <r>Steventhedreamer</r>'s album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3BtmhsxvxavvkC2naRdXin?si=-yot_5s-T5uofAWBSUxJow">Synchobonk Collection</a> is a brilliant listen, by the way.</p>

<p>This one I just love, the ascending notes and crispy warm square waves create a lovely sense of nostalgia, I was inspired to make this when I listened to some of the Undertale soundtrack (Most notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B69GfSqEZEs">Fallen Down</a>) and felt reminiscent of the past.
And before you ask, I KNOW THAT I SPELT IT WRONG!!!</p>

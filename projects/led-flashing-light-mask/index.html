<h1>LED Flashing light mask</h1>
</div><div class="body">
<p>This is something I made for my mum a little while ago. It's an eye mask that flashes red LEDs at a user-controlled speed and brightness. Now, I'm no medical expert, so I have no clue why she wanted it, but according to her it's something that helps relieve stress, so I went and made it.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>
<p>I began by ordering a bunch of parts online from <a href="https://www.bitsboxuk.com/">Bitsboxuk my beloved</a>, and a little while later they all showed up.</p>
<p><img src="parts.jpg" alt="Parts" /></p>
<p>These parts included a DC converting plug for power, better potentiometers, a switch, and the ATtiny 13 that would run the code.</p>
<h2>Starting off - The case</h2>
<p>I started off by making the case. I ordered a nice little box and began work drilling holes.</p>
<p><img style='width: 50%; height: auto;' src="case.PNG" alt="The box" /></p>
<p>Ready to drill! :3</p>
<p><img src="ready2drill.jpg" alt="Ready to drill!" /></p>
<p>And, after a long night of planning and drilling..</p>
<p><img src="drilled.jpg" alt="Drilled!!" /></p>
<p>Ok.. now the box is finished... what to do with this little guy?</p>

<h2>Circuitry</h2>
<p>I started off by making the circuit on a breadboard with my arduino. I wrote some code to read the value of the speed potentiometer and BOOM, led flashing.</p>
<p>But.. how am I gonna get this onto my attiny?</p>
<h2>Programming the ATtiny</h2>
<p>So, I laid out my arduino ready to program the ATtiny..</p>
<p><img src="programmingattiny.jpg" alt="Programming the ATtiny" /></p>
<p>..but, nothing? It's not uploading! Why not??!?!</p>
<p>And.. after many hours... I realised I had to burn the bootloader program to the arduino....</p>
<p><img src="burnbootloader.jpg" alt="Bootloader burned." /></p>
<p>And, now I can program the ATtiny..</p>

<p><img src="runningonattiny.jpg" alt="Running the circuit on the ATtiny" /></p>
<p>Yippee!</p>
<p>Ok, I have the ATtiny programmed, the circuit crudely drawn out, now to start combining the case and the circuit.</p>
<h2>Circuitry II</h2>
<p>I soldered many wires to the different knobs and levers</p>
<p><img src="insides1.jpg" alt="Wires in case" /></p>
<p>And then I soldered them to the breadboard!</p>
<p><img src="insides2.jpg" alt="Wires from case soldered to the breadboard" /></p>
<p>I cut the mask part off of a red light mask my mum already owned that didn't flash, and attached it to the above mess.

<p>Before finishing it off I went out for a nice bike ride</p>

<p>And then, I finally closed it up for good! Here's a video of it in action, on my mothers bedside table.</p>

<h1>jumbledFont</h1>
<p>A little while ago I made a font. It was originally for this website, but it wasn't very readable. I don't really use it anymore, but I'd rather put it here than have it rot on my hard drive.</p>
<p>Each character is 10x20 pixels, with a 2 pixel gap between characters. For best results use it with a size of 16 with antialiasing disabled.</p>
<p>It doesn't have tons of glyphs, just the english alphabet, numbers, and some symbols!</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like in action:</p>

<h2><a href="jumbledFont.ttf" download target="_blank">DOWNLOAD</a></h2>
<p>If you use it in anything, tell me! I'd love to hear :3</p>

<h1>The Internet</h1>
<p>&quot;This, Jen, is the internet.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a prop of 'The Internet' from 'The IT Crowd'. It flashes just like the real thing!</p>
<p>I made this for my friends birthday last year as both him and I really like the show.</p>
<p>On the inside is an awfully soldered 555 timer circuit to control the light, as well as a 9v battery.</p>

<h1>Flashing Eye Mask</h1>
<p>My mum asked me to build her this, I don't really get why but of course I'm happy to help her out. Apparently it's soothing or calming or whatever, what's important is that she likes it!</p>
<p>It's made with an ATtiny microcontroller, and the two knobs control the brightness and speed of the flash.</p>

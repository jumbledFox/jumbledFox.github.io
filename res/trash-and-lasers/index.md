Trash and Lasers is a game I made in around a week for the Polymars [SEAJAM](https://itch.io/jam/seajam). You place mirrors down to direct a laser beam across the level, making sure to hit all the floating trash and avoid any fish!

A tutorial is built into the game but it isn't that good. Click the Plus button to make a new mirror (there's a limit!), this new mirror will be automatically selected, or you can click a mirror to select it. Once a mirror is selected, you can remove it with the Minus button, or rotate it with the two rotation buttons. There's also a button to remove all of the mirrors which can be quite useful.

I think it's quite a fun little puzzle game.

All of the assets were made by me, especially including the bloody splatters of exploded fish >:3

This game has no bugs I know of.. but if it does - not to sound dispassionate - I don't really care.

Enjoy!!!

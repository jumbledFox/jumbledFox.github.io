# About me

I mainly program in Rust, although I occasionally use Python and C++, as well as web stuff (which I do NOT enjoy).

I love to cycle, as well as swim in the sea every now and then, both of which are very fun :3

I like all sorts of music, but my favourite genre is prog rock!!!

I go by 'jumbledFox' on basically every platform.

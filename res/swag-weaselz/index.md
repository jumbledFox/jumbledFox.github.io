Swag Weasels is a quick little shoot-em-up I made in around a day for a friend of mine's birthday.

You play as a hip and trendy weasel being barraged by an onslaught of cubic killers, but worry not, for you have three tough and trusty firearms at your disposal!

## How to play

Move the mouse to aim, and click or tap to shoot!

Switch weapons using the buttons at the top, or (for the speedier players out there), with the number keys on your keyboard.

Your 'Cred' (street cred) is how many kills you've got. At high enough amounts you start unlocking some pretty sweet articles of clothing! 

Your 'Swag' is your health! It increases periodically, but those pesky enemies will do their best to bring it down.

Powerups spawn every now and then, too! One of them makes bullets bouncy, and the other makes bullets more penetrative.

## I hope you enjoy it!

This was a lot of fun to make, one day I hope to make a sequal, maybe in Rust with Macroquad!

This used to be hosted on Scratch, but I decided to keep it private and host it here instead, as blood and guns (although cartoony) might be a bit too gory for the Scratch community guidelines.
